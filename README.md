# Coupon-Recommendation
This project aims to predict whether the customer will accept the coupon(Restaurant/Bar/Cafe) or not based on given attributes. In this project analyzed the various factors that affecting the coupon redemption and as well as studied the customer behavior. 
The dataset consists of 24 features and 12684 data points. From the exploratory data analysis, I found that if the coupon is bar then there is 58% chance to accept the coupon. Females are accepting more coupons compared to male as thier number is nearly equal. Females are accepting more Bar coupons and males are accepting more Restaurant coupons. Females with age <20 are accepting more bar coupons and next coffee house coupons. Based on weather conditions if it is snowy there is a 54% chance to accept the coupon. For 88% of people it is taking more than 25min to reach a Restaurant/Bar/Cafe.
Coming to ML models, the random forest gave the highest accuracy among the other models, with accuracy of 72%. The decision tree classifier and logestic regression had accuracy of 67.4% and 68.7% respectively.The KNN had the lowest accuracy of 66%.
